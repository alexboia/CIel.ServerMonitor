# Ciel.ServerMonitor
Ciel/NextUp Server Log Message Window Monitor Utility

This is a command line utility desined and built to overcome an issue with older version of NextUp ERP server whereby the server's message log window would continue to accumulate and, as a result, the program's memory consumption would increase, causing the program itself to become unresponsive, as well as the entire system.
